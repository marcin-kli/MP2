# UX

## Strategy

Tha main aim of this project is to create a simple website which shows information about earthquakes and interacts as a mobile app.
The site is divided into three parts. Major earthquakes in the last 30 days, major earthquakes in history, and basic explanation what causes the earthquakes.
Site owner goal: provide interactive solution to search, display data and information about earthquakes.
User goal: find relevant data and some basic knowledge about earthquakes.

## Scope

As a MVP (minimum viable product) I divide landing page into 3 sections which show below features:
- list of the earthquakes in chosen period of time
- list of the 20 the biggest earthquakes in the past
- educational information
- map of the earthquakes as a search result

### User stories

As a site owner:
- I would like to show all information in a simple way on the website. Everything beyond should be redirected to external resources.
- I would like to show data about 20 the biggest earthquakes in the past.
- I would like to let users to search through earthquake events and show data as a list or on the map.

As a first time user:
- I would like to find in an easy way what I can do on the website.
- I would like to check earthquake events without any scientific knowledge needed.

As a returning user:
- I would like to check all of the major events for from the last 7, 15 or 30 days.
- I would like to set custom settings and see all of the results in a list order.
- I would like to see my search results on the map.
- I would like to be able to contact with the site administrator.


## Structure of the website

All of the content is displayed on one page site with menu list on the top. 
In the middle of the site, on the landing page, there are three sections to choose by the user.
After selecting an option for the last/custom events user can select or deselect additional map option from top menu on mobile device.
On desktop the features are enabled by default. Changes can be also made from this menu.
At the bottom there is a footer with contact information and social links.
